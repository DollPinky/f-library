# Test Travis CI Build

This file is created to trigger a Travis CI build and test the configuration.

## Current Status
- Repository: Quan-TheDoctor/Library-Management
- Branch: main
- Travis CI: Connected but no builds triggered

## Next Steps
1. Check Travis CI dashboard
2. Verify build status
3. Review build logs if available

## Expected Behavior
- Travis CI should detect the push
- Build should start automatically
- Status should change from "build unknown" to "build passing/failing"
